# Create two variables, A and B, whose values are True and False respectively (just to avoid confusion, you can hard code A = True and B = False)

# Using logical operators, calculate:
#The output of an OR logic gate (A or B) and store the value in C

# The output of an AND logic gate (A and B) and store the value in D

# The output of a NAND (not D) and store the value in D_NOT

# Finally, the output of the XOR gate (C and D_NOT) and store it in XOR

# Can you do all the steps in one line?
