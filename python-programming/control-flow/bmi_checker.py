# Given 2 parameters, height and weight, calculate the parameter BMI (Google the formula).

# Using the parameter BMI, write a series of if statements that print the following outcomes:
# below 18.5 --> 'Your BMI is x. You're in the underweight range.'
# between 18.5 and 24.9 --> 'Your BMI is x. You're in the healthy weight range.'
# between 25 and 29.9 --> 'Your BMI is x. You're in the overweight range.'
# between 30 and 39.9 --> 'Your BMI is x. You're in the obese range.'


# Test your code with the following cases by substituting them in for weight and height values in your code:
# Height: 1.83m, Weight: 85kg
# Height: 1.55m, Weight: 61kg
# Height: 2.09m, Weight: 135kg
