# Given 2 parameters, altitude (ft) and airspeed (knots)

# Write a program that categorises entries into 'safe flying' and 'unsafe flying' based on the following criteria:

# An altitude below 100ft or above 50000ft is considered unsafe flying.
# An airspeed below 60 knots or above 500 knots is considered unsafe flying.
# If altitude and airspeed are outside these ranges, the flight is considered as safe.
# CLUE: You will have to figure out the syntax for using and/or keywords in if statements

# Try to write this as cleanly as possible and test your code with the following by substituting in again:
# Altitude: 25000ft, Airspeed: 300 knots
# Altitude: 50001ft, Airspeed: 250 knots
# Altitude: 90ft, Airspeed: 125 knots
