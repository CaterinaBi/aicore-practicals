# You have shapes with measurements:
# Cuboid: Height (h): 25/7, Width (w): 25/2, Length (l): 35
# Cone: Height (h): 10, Radius of base (r): 3
#Calculate the volume and surface areas of the shapes using the following equations.
h = 25/7
w = 25/2
l = 35
h_2 = 10
r = 3
pi = 3.14

cuboid = "cuboid"
cone = "cone"
